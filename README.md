# License Plate Rectification with Spatial Transformer Networks
The Spatial Transformer Layer, as proposed in the paper [Spatial Transformer Layer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02025), is employed in this project to rectify license plates. The rectification process aims to improve the characteristics of license plates, thereby enhancing the accuracy of license plate recognition systems.

## Training on STN
* run 'STN/data/preprocess.py' to prepare the dataset
* run 'STN/STN_Train.py' for training 

## Testing on STN
* run 'STN/STN_Test.py' for testing
